This is a Multimedia Project

Designing an Audio Compression Plugin with 3D spectral waveform graphs for visualization purposes.

The Audio compression capabilities will allow for changes in attack, release, knee length and ratio.
The visualization will show the frequency waveform graphs in the XYZ plane of both the compressed and uncompressed audio.
